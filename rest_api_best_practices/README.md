# Best Practices for designing REST APIs

In this video, we will look at 9 best practices that you must make sure to follow for your next backend project. 
We will to take into account **security**, **performance**, and **ease of use** for API consumers. 
And the good news is we will explore all these best practices with a simple Express application.

Here `express_app` contains a finished code to the application that we will build together in the video, `REST API - Best Practices.pdf` 
contains the lecture notes that we will be using in the video, and `README.md` contains a curated list of resources on each of the best practices.

## 📚 Resources

There are several resources that we will be looking at during the course of this video. A list of all those resources can be found here. 
I have divided them into 9 groups based on what topic we are considering.

1. Accept and respond with JSON
  - https://www.json.org/json-en.html
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
  - https://www.mongodb.com/basics/bson

2. Use nouns instead of verbs in endpoint paths
3. Name collections with plural nouns
4. Nesting resources for hierarchical objects
  - https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs

5. Handle errors gracefully and return standard error codes
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status

6. Allow filtering, sorting, and pagination

7. Maintain Good Security Practices
