# Deploy a ML Model with Fast API and AWS EC2

In this video, let's have a look at how you can deploy your ML models using Fast API on AWS EC2 instance. 
Deploying your ML models or integrating them with your web application, is a quite important task. 
FastAPI with it's speed, ease of use, built-in support and documentation is an ideal candiadate for this task.

## ü§î Choosing a ML model

Usually you might wanna deploy your own models, or the ones you have trained and tuned to a specific use case or dataset.
For this demo, however, we are going to use a pretained model. 

One of the best sources for finding pretrained models is [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co). We will choose Facebook's 
[DEIT](https://huggingface.co/facebook/deit-base-distilled-patch16-224) or Distilled data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) model
which has been pre-trained and fine-tuned on ImageNet-1k (1 million images, 1,000 classes).

## üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Building a Fast API application

For this process, you need to follow along with the video. 
However, just make sure of these 2 things -
1. You have a rust compiler installed on your system. If not head over to [Getting started with Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
2. You should have PyTorch installed inside the virtual environment. For this you can use the command (MacOS, Windows) below. 
If you want to customise the install, checkout [Getting started with PyTorch locally](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

   ```bash
   pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
   ```
## üå© Deploy on AWS EC2

We will make use of Nginx. Nginx is an open-source Web Server written in C that was designed with the purpose of being the world‚Äôs fastest Web Server. 
It was created in 2004 by Igor Sysoev. One of the major advantages that it will offer is the ability to easily add an SSL certificate. 

After creating the EC2 instance (Ubuntu OS) and installing nginx, you need to add the following inside `/etc/nignx/sites-enabled`:

```
server {     
        listen 80;
        listen 443 ssl;
        ssl on;
        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/server.key;     
        server_name xx.xxx.xxx.xx;     
        location / {         
                 proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;    
        } 
}
```

Now, if we run our app using uvicorn, we can see the app running at the public IP and interact with it. 
However, this is not all we need to do. We need to ensure that uvicorn keeps running even though we are not connected via SSH. 
Moreover, it‚Äôd be a bonus if we could run a bash script to activate the server every time the EC2 instance restarts. Let‚Äôs do these now.

Inside `/etc/systemd/system` we create a new service (say) - `deit.service`

```
[Unit]
Description=Uvicorn instance to serve DEIT-FastAPI
After=network.target

[Service]
User=ubuntu
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/youtube/deploy_deit_aws_ec2/fast_api_app
Environment="PATH=/home/ubuntu/youtube/deploy_deit_aws_ec2/fast_api_app/venv/bin"
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/youtube/deploy_deit_aws_ec2/fast_api_app/venv/bin/uvicorn main:app

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

After saving this file - run the command from your home directory.
```
sudo systemctl start nginx && cd /etc/systemd/system && sudo systemctl start deit.service
```

Finally, you can set a crontab to handle accidental EC2 instance reboot (so that you don't have to run the last command, over and over again!).
For that create a bash script - script.sh in your home directory. Make sure to allow execute permissions using sudo chmod+x script.sh. 
```
#!/bin/bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
cd /etc/systemd/system
sudo systemctl start linkedin_clone.service
```

Now run crontab -e, and at the end of the file, add the line ‚Äî

```
@reboot /home/ubuntu/script.sh
```

Save this, reboot your instance and see the magic happen üôÇü™Ñ
